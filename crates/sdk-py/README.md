# trysoma_sdk_core

Core native bindings for the [Soma](https://github.com/trysoma/soma) Python SDK.

## Overview

This package provides the low-level native bindings (built with Rust and PyO3) that power the Soma Python SDK. It handles performance-critical operations like schema parsing, validation, and code generation.

**Most users should install `trysoma_sdk` instead**, which provides a high-level Python API built on top of this package.

## Installation

```bash
pip install trysoma_sdk
```

If you need the core bindings directly:

```bash
pip install trysoma_sdk_core
```

## Supported Platforms

- macOS (x86_64, ARM64)
- Linux (x86_64, ARM64)
- Python 3.10+
